# coachella contest

This was a contest that occured on a radio station website in Feb 2011.  They stated "be comment 40000 with the word hipster and win coachella tickets."  I wrote a screen scraper with Ruby that would automatically add comments from fortune cookie quotes.  After running the script for a few days I determined that it was not possible as I calculated the time it would take for the server to process that many requests would after the Coachella concert.  They eventually cancelled the contest but did not state why.
